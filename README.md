# üïí Digital Clock System on Zynq-7000 FPGA

## üìö Project Description

This project implements a comprehensive **Digital Clock System** on a **Zynq-7000 FPGA**, featuring five major time-related functionalities:

### 1. Time and Date Display
- Displays real-time clock and date using DCF77 signal synchronization.
- Supports user-defined date override via hardware switches.

### 2. Alarm Clock
- User-configurable alarm time.
- Alarm can be snoozed or dismissed via short or long button presses.
- Visual indicators show active alarm and ringing status.

### 3. Time Switch (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- Enables timed on/off control (e.g., for a device or relay).
- Allows configuration of "on" and "off" times via user input.

### 4. Countdown Timer (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
- User can set a specific countdown duration.
- When countdown reaches zero, a visual alert is triggered.

### 5. Stopwatch with Lap Feature
- Supports start, pause, reset, and lap time capture.
- Lap values can be viewed and cleared by the user.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Design Notes
- Runs on a **10 kHz master clock**.
- All timing is driven by internally generated enables: `en_1K`, `en_100`, `en_10`, and `en_1`.
- Designed using **VHDL only**:
- Fully synchronous design with **no inferred latches**.
- Button inputs are debounced and interpreted via `*_imp` (impulse) and `*_long` (long press) signals.

## üß™ Testing

A comprehensive **VHDL testbench** is provided to simulate and validate key use cases:

- Mode transitions and user interactions
- Alarm set, snooze, and disable workflow
- Stopwatch operation including lap and reset
- Countdown setup and expiration handling
